NEW UPDATE: AUTO.sh automates the process below

git clone https://github.com/manves/AutomatedKaliLinuxFix
cd AutomatedKaliLinuxFix
chmod +x AUTO.sh
sudo ./AUTO.sh

Bash File to automatically add Kali Sources.list file to current os

It is a simple script I wrote. It's my first automated script for adding the kali repository to the current os you want use.
Updates will be in the future.

to use just

git clone https://github.com/manves/kalifix
cd kalifix
chmod +x kalifix.sh ./kalifix.sh or bash kalifix.sh

there is a shebang that points to the bash interpreter so if you run it without the "bash" it will still run.
