# kalifix
Bash File to automatically add Kali Sources.list file to current os

It is a simple script I wrote. It's my first automated script for adding the kali repository to the current os you want use.
Updates will be in the future.

to use just
git clone https://github.com/manves/kalifix
cd kalifix
chmod +x kalifix.sh ./kalifix.sh or bash kalifix.sh
there is a shebang that points to the bash interpreter so if you run it without the "bash" it will still run.
